31C. Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles

Notwithstanding anything contained in article [[13]] , no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV[2] shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article [[14]]  or article [[19]] ; [3]and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy:

Provided that where such law is made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.
