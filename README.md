# A Graph of the Constitution of India

The `constitution.ipynb` documents the creation of a graph of the Articles of the Constitution linked to each other via mentions. Various graph metrics can be calculated on the resulting graph.

By considering each Article as a note, we can piggyback on the functionalities of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to also get a UI to interact with the graph. The required folder of markdown files for this is created at `obsidian/`. You can open this folder as a vault in Obsidian.
