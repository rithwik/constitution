# A Graph of the Constitution of India

The `constitution.ipynb` notebook documents the creation of a graph of the articles of the Constitution linked to each other via mentions.

Various graph metrics can be calculated on the resulting graph. That would be enough to satisfy graph theoretic curiousity, but since we are already here, we might as well take it a little further.

By making each article into a note we can piggyback on the functionalities of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to get a UI to interact with the Constitution in a novel way. 

The initial set of notes for this was created automatically (_refer concluding code in the notebook_). Editing was required for the parts where the code failed. And then the parts, schedules, and appendices were added and linked manually.

The folder which can be opened as a _vault_ in Obsidian is at `obsidian/`. The #roamcult has rBooks. This is probably an oBook, then?
